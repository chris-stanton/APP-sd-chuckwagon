# Custer State Park Chuckwagon
#### Family trip over Memorial Weekend to South Dakota's Badlands, Mount Rushmore, Keystone and Custer State Park.  At Custer State Park we decided to do a fourwheeling tour through the park followed up with a chuckwagon dinner after.  After dinner, I caught my Father dancing and completely out of his comfort zone.  This is a tribute to that great experience!
